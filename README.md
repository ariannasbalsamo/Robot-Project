# Robot-Project
The robot project consisted of writing a code on arduino that was going to be uploaded into a robot. The robot had to go through an obstacle course following a black line, the code had to be adjusted to recognize the color of the course, when it would reach the end it would launch a duck into a target, then it would make its way back
